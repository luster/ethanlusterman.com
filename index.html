    <p>
    I graduated from The Cooper Union
    for the Advancement of Science and Art with a B.E. in Electrical Engineering
    this past May, and I am currently pursuing an M.E. in Electrical Engineering under
    the advisement of Professor Sam Keene.
    My research is focused on the intersection of machine learning, signal processing,
    and music. During my time at Cooper Union, I have worked on projects in music genre
    classification and clustering, audio dereverberation (think echo),
    music transcription, digital guitar effects generation, and psychoacoustic compression of
    audio (think wav to mp3!), among others.

    <p>
    I work as a part-time software engineer at The Hackerati, located in New York, NY.
    I worked on a team that maintained the APIs and editorial CMS
    for a Top 50 website. I have also worked on a RESTful user API in Django,
    meant to serve as a starting point for new applications that need to support users.
    Most recently, I have been working on a big data/machine learning project for a top
    market research company using tools such as Hadoop, Pig, MATLAB, and Python.

    <p>
    In my free time, I like to write and play music. I am a guitar player and singer-songwriter.
    I started playing in bands when I was in middle school, and more recently I started writing
    my own material.
    I self-released my first EP, Better Off, with the help of a few friends this past year.
    I have performed at venues and festivals such as Bowery Electric, Lit Lounge, The Vibe Lounge,
    and Vans Warped Tour. This summer, I'll be working on a lengthier release and more shows!
